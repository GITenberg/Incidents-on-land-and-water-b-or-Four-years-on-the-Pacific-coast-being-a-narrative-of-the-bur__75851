summary: A native of Kingston, Massachusetts, Mrs. Bates sailed to California in 1850
  on board the Nonantum, a coaler commanded by her husband. On reaching that state,
  the Bateses undertook hotelkeeping in Marysville, 1851-1854. Incidents on land and
  water (1857) contains Mrs. Bates's hair-raising account of her voyage to California,
  when fires forced the scuttling of three ships on which the Bateses sailed. Mrs.
  Bates recounts hardships of the mining town, with special attention to the life
  of women and children in the camps, and gives details of a tour of the Sacramento
  Valley.
